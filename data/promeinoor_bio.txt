I grew up in a family where I was nurtured with Bengali cultural norms and traditions. My interest in research initiated from my family. My father who is a Professor of Anthropology has bolstered my passion to take this path. After successfully completing my Higher Secondary School Certificate, I got admitted into Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Sylhet and chose Anthropology as my intended field in undergraduate study. Besides study, I am a professional singer and have achieved many national awards. I have also performed in reputed Bengali Classical Festival. My affection towards music is greatly influenced by my motherâ€™s artistic worldview.
